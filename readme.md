# Gopcaml-mode hits front page of hacker news!

[Gopcaml-mode](https://gitlab.com/gopiandcode/gopcaml-mode) is a
plugin for supporting structural editing of ocaml code. Made by yours
truly (hint: look at the name).

It hit the front page of hacker news, and I think at some point was
one of the top 10.

I've added this repo as a quick documentation of it's rise to fame!

- Here's the front page at the time I made this repo:

- while, it's dropped to 17 now, I believe at some point earlier it had hit one of the top 10. There is this bot that retweets all the top 10 hn posts:

- and it retweeted Gopcaml-mode earlier:
